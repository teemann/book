<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<p>
When you are seing this, that means, that you have successfully set up your development environment and already have compiled your very first program.
This program is basically a very simple http server, written in c, that can serve either this index page or an automatically generated page based
on the page you request. Click <a href="testpage.html">here</a> for example to see, what that means.<br>
At the end of the book, we will program this very program together and you will be able to understand how it works.<br><br>
But for now I wish you a happy reading.
